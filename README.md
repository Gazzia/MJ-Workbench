Creating a game master app for a friend

Nothing interesting here, but if you really want to check it out, you can serve it locally with `npm start`, even though access to back-end will be blocked as I hid the api keys 🤷‍♂️

**Fact**: I mostly use **pnpm** insteam of regular npm for small personal projects like this one, so pnpm's lockfile might be more relevant
